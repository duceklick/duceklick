<h1>Hi, I'm Thomas! <br/><a  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjweippert/">Cybersecurity Professional</a>

<h2>🙋‍♂️ About Me</h2>
Hello everyone and welcome to my GitHub page, my name is Thomas, but I do like to go by TJ! I am a former Firefighter EMT that is transitioning to the world of Cybersecurity due to injuries I have obtained over the 10+ year career I have had. My entire life I have been an avid tech fan, from playing video games to building my own Gaming PC's. I graduated from Fullstack Academy's Cybersecurity Bootcamp July 3rd, 2025, and now I am studying to take my CompTIA Security+ exam in August of the 2025. I am very fast learner and very eager to get started on this new career path I have choosen. I still like to show off my accomplishments from my years as a Firefighter EMT so you will see down below my certifications I have received from there as well. I am an open book and if you would like to know anything else about me, or want to collab on a project together you can email me or message me on LinkedIn. All links are above and in my profile. Thanks for stopping by!

<h2>⚡ Fun Facts About Me:</h2>

- My dad as well as almost every man in my family was in some branch of the military, so I raised very strict and military like. My parents growing up also were considered the "cool parents" per my friends 😁.
- I am in love in Video Games, my first memory of playing Video Games was playing my Dad's PS1 back in an old trailer on a little farm in Texas we lived in.
- I love puzzles or anything similar that gets my brain going. If it makes me think, I want to do it!
- I am from Texas. Lived in the Houston area from birth until I was 20 years old. Moved to Louisiana 10 years ago and still living here. Only regret is I wish the food here did not taste SOOO good.
- I started playing the Pokemon TCG in the beginning of 2025, and since then I have played in countless tournaments as well as competiting to NAIC!
