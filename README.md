<h2>🙋‍♂️ About Me</h2>
Hello everyone and welcome to my GitHub page, my name is Thomas, but I do like to go by TJ! I am a former Firefighter EMT that is transitioning to the world of Cybersecurity due to injuries I have obtained over the 10+ year career I have had. My entire life I have been an avid tech fan, from playing video games to building my own Gaming PC's. I graduated from Fullstack Academy's Cybersecurity Bootcamp July 3rd, 2025, and now I am studying to take my CompTIA Security+ exam in August of the 2025. I am very fast learner and very eager to get started on this new career path I have choosen. I still like to show off my accomplishments from my years as a Firefighter EMT so you will see down below my certifications I have received from there as well. I am an open book and if you would like to know anything else about me, or want to collab on a project together you can email me or message me on LinkedIn. All links are above and in my profile. Thanks for stopping by!
